# GreenWithEnvy (GWE)
GWE is a GTK system utility designed to provide information, control the fans and overclock your NVIDIA video card
and graphics processor.

# 🔴 🔴 Looking for new maintainer(s)! 🔴 🔴
Most probably my next GPU will be an AMD and, if that happens, I won't be able to provide adequate support for this project anymore. For this reason I'm looking for new maintainer(s).
If you are interested and have adequate knowledge of Python, please get in touch replying to this issue:
https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe/-/issues/195

## 💡 Features

* Show general GPU stats (model name, driver version, gpu/memory/power usage, clocks, temps, etc)
* GPU and Memory overclock offset profiles
* Custom Fan curve profiles
* Change power limit
* Historical data graphs

## 📦 How to get GWE
If you don't like to reading manuals and/or you don't know what the Nvidia CoolBits are,
you can watch the following How To made by [Intelligent Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH4d4o0Otxa7BNYs5Z5UEjg):

### Distro specific packages
#### Arch Linux
Install the `gwe` package from the AUR using your favourite helper, for example `yay -S gwe`.

#### Fedora
GWE avaliable in official Fedora [repos](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gwe) for F31+: `sudo dnf install gwe`

For older Fedora releases you can use [COPR package](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/gwe/): `sudo dnf copr enable atim/gwe -y && sudo dnf install gwe`

#### Clone project and install
If you have not installed GWE yet:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe.git
cd gwe
git checkout release
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
meson . build --prefix /usr
ninja -v -C build
sudo ninja -v -C build install
```

#### Update old installation
If you installed GWE from source code previously and you want to update it:
```bash
cd gwe
git fetch
git checkout release
git reset --hard origin/release
git submodule init
git submodule update
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
meson . build --prefix /usr

#### Run
Once installed, to start it you can simply execute on a terminal:
```bash
gwe
```

#### ⚠ Bumblebee and Optimus
If you want to use GWE with Bumblebee you need to start it with `optirun` and set the `--ctrl-display` parameter to `:8`:

```bash
optirun gwe --ctrl-display ":8"
```

<!--
## Application entry
To add a desktop entry for the application run the following command:
```bash
gwe --application-entry
```
If you don't want to create this custom rule you can run gwe as root
(using sudo) but we advise against this solution.

## ❓ FAQ
### I see some message about CoolBits in the Overclock/Fan profile section, what's that?
Coolbits was a Windows registry hack for Nvidia graphics cards Windows drivers, that allows
tweaking features via the Nvidia driver control panel.
Something similar is available also on Linux and is the only way to enable Overclock and manual Fan control.
To know more about Coolbits and how to enable them click
[here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Tips_and_tricks#Enabling_overclocking)
(to enable both OC and Fan control you need to set it to `12`).

### Why the memory overclock offsets effectively applied does not match the one set in the Nvidia Settings app?
Because Memory Transfer Rate, what Nvidia Settings reports and changes,
is different from the effective Memory Clock, what is actually being
displayed by GWE. It is also what other Windows applications like MSI Afterburner show.
The Memory Transfer Rate is simply double the Memory Clock.

### Where are the settings and profiles stored on the filesystem?
| Installation type |                     Location                     |
|-------------------|:------------------------------------------------:|
| Source code       | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (usually `$HOME/.config/gwe`) |

### GreenWithEnvy, why using such name?
The name comes from the slogan of the GeForce 8 series, that was "Green with envy".
Nvidia is meant to be pronounced "invidia", which means envy in Latin (and Italian). And their logo is green so, GreenWithEnvy

### Discord server
If you want to help testing or developing it would be easier to get in touch using the discord server of the project: https://discord.gg/xBybdRt
Just write a message on the general channel saying how you want to help (test, dev, etc) and quoting @leinardi. If you don't use discor but still want to help just open a new issue here.


### Can I support this project some other way?

Something simple that everyone can do is to star it on both [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe) and [GitHub](https://github.com/leinardi/gwe).
Feedback is always welcome: if you found a bug or would like to suggest a feature,
feel free to open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe/issues).

## ⚠ Dropped Flatpak support
Flatpak support (and any other sandboxed packaging like snap or appimage) has been dropped.
The new design separates GWE into two parts, The GUI that only shows information and handes fans and
a small subprocess that runs with elevated priveleges to apply overclocking settings. This step was
necessary to include support for wayland. Other projects like [LACT](https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/blob/master/pkg/README.md#why-is-there-no-appimageflatpakdocker) have taken a similar approach.

## ⚠ Dropped PyPI support
Development builds were previously distributed using PyPI. This way of distributing the software is simple
but requires the user to manually install all the non Python dependencies like cairo, glib, appindicator3, etc.
The current implementation of the historical data uses a new library, Dazzle, that requires Gnome 3.30 which is
available, using Python Object introspection, only starting from Ubuntu 18.10 making the latest Ubuntu LTS, 18.04,
unsupported.
A solution for all this problems is distributing the app via Flatpak, since with it all the dependencies
will be bundled and provided automatically, making possible to use Gnome 3.30 features also on distributions
using an older version of Gnome.

**No new build will be published on PyPI**.

### Uninstall pip version
If you have already installed GWE via `pip`, please make sure to uninstall it completely before moving to a newer version:

```bash
pip3 uninstall gwe
rm -rf ~/.config/gwe
```
