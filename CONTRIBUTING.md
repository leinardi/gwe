## Current policy

- **Issues:** New issues are not being triaged or answered.
- **Pull requests:** New pull requests are not being reviewed or merged.
- **CI/automation:** Publishing pipelines may be disabled and out of date.

This repository remains available **for historical reference**.

## Want to continue development?

If you'd like to keep GWE alive, please:

1. **Fork** this repository and maintain your own version.
2. **Publish under a different identifier** that doesn't reference me personally:
    - **Git hosting:** use your own namespace or an organization (not under `leinardi`).
    - **Flatpak / Flathub:** choose a new App ID (e.g. `io.github.<yourname>.GWE` or an org-owned ID), **not**
      `com.leinardi.gwe`.

You're welcome to reuse code under the project's license (GPL-3.0-or-later). Please update names, icons, and metadata as
appropriate for your fork.

## Thank you

Huge thanks to everyone who contributed, tested, packaged, or supported GWE over the years. 💚
